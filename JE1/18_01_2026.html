      <p>One of my favourite things about hiking in Scotland is the colours that appear in the seasons, with the wetter seasons creating lushious purples, deep greens, energetic oranges, and screaming mossy greens.
      </p>
      <p> Here are a few photos I took on my last hike up Ben Ledi, that made me brain feel balanced whilst also making mky inner artists heart skip with excitment.
      </p>
      <p>Also, I watched a movie that will stick with me for the rest of my life this week, called Train Dreams. The set designer has posted some insane behind the scenes details of processes used and I found it very inspiring. You could tell from watching the movie alone, that the level of thought and care that was used to develop the spaces for the movie and keeping the forest, a key witness in the movie, integral to the scenes. Feeling very inspired witnessing this movie and very fotunate it exists in my lifetime.
