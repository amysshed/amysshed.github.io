      <p>This week, I went on an artist date to the RSA in Edinburgh and stumbled upon their exhibition “Origin. RSA200: Celebrating Together”, showing pieces ranging from the founding of the RSA in 1826 to now.
         This exhibition highlights “how influence and inspiration have passed through generations of artists from tutor-to-student”  
         <a href="https://www.royalscottishacademy.org/viewing-room/59-origin-stories/" class="journal-link">
   [Origin. RSA200: Celebrating Together]
         </a>
 and I would highly recommend a visit. 
      </p>
       <p>
       At the back of the exhibit is a film called SÁL, about the HMY Lolaire disaster, where 205 of 285 servicemen sailing home for New Years after surviving the First World War, drowned on the coast of Stornoway after the boat hit rocks and sank. 
       A quote taken from the film's description text; “History tells us what happened. Art tells us how it felt.”
        </p>
      <p> When I first sat down to watch the piece, I was in awe of the beauty of each shot, capturing the sea and coast as if being filmed straight through a pair of eyes. 
         The reflections, colours, motions, and lines were so organically translated into this film.
         As I began to read the description and learn about the HMY Loraine Disaster, the humanity grew, with each scene capturing the beauty and hypnotising capabilities of the sea, contrasted with the dark history that haunts the shores, unchanged from that fatal disaster. 
         There was one particular shot that created a pang in my chest, a dark, clapping surface of waves travelling in all directions, a madness, but yet the hypnotising calmness of the sea was ever present. 
      </p>

       <p>I immediately wanted to transcribe the images into ink, feel the motion of each direction, the soothing of each surge and the sharpness of each peak. 
          Here are two ink drawings I was inspired to create.
       </p>

     <p>If you have an hour or so, I highly recommend watching the film linked here: <a href="https://www.royalscottishacademy.org/content/feature/2149/artworks-25338-dalziel-scullion-rsa-sal-2018/" class="journal-link">
   [DALZIEL + SCULLION RSA. SÁL, 2018].
         </a>
        But even better, I would recommend going to the (FREE!) RSA exhibition to explore the full range of Scottish artists and watch the film in high resolution. 
        Thank you to Dalziel and Scullion for making this piece that not only educates us about this tragic time in Scottish history but also makes us feel.
