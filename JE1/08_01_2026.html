      <p>2025 was a year of shedding. Shedding blockages, toughness, and performances.
        It was a transformative year for me where my whole reality turned upside down, but it was all my own doing.
        My lifestyle completely slowed down, I realised I had been running at walls for a long time with my goal being to show my strength and perseverance.
        To show people I am capable.</p>
        
       <p> "Why do you need to feel capable?", the question a counsellor asked me in April last year that broke everything. 
        I was caught in a circle of anxiousness; anxious to be capable of anything thrown at me, anxious to be doing things wrong, then anxious to disappoint.
        A cycle that had me constantly overthinking my character, my ability. Was it all just an act? What have I been doing this whole time? Who the hell am I? </p>
          
        <p>So I began to say something that pre-counsellor me would have feared to say out loud. "I've not done that before, but i'm happy to try". </p>
        <p>And the more I said it, the more comfortable I got with it. <p/>
        <p>And the more comfortable I got with it, the more I opened myself up to trying new things.<p/>
        <p>The more I tried new things, the closer I got to knowing myself.</p>
        
        <p>And the more I tried new things, the more I realised that my wildest dreams were closer than I thought. 
        With time, I had a realisation; I would rather give my wildest dreams a try than to just keep them as dreams.</p>

        <p>So now we are here, 2026. And I'm trying. I made this website as a place where I can reflect and keep a track of my trying, creating a space to share different types of mediums I use to explore my creativity. 
        Time to jump!
